## Description 

This application uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store workout information. When the user loads the page, they can create a new workout, or continue a previous workout. In addition, the user can view all of the stats of their previous workout data. 

Mongoose and MongoDB are alternatives to using MySQL as a database. The syntax for using these databases is slightly different, but I found the MongoDB is easier to use because the syntax is very similar to JavaScript. This application is deployed with MongoDB database to Heroku.
